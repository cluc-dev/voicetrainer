# Voicetrainer - a CircuitPython Hardware Project

This has been a WIP for a while but a Reddit post made me realize I'm not the only one thinking about these kinds of things. 

More info on CircuitPython can be found here: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/what-is-circuitpython

If you know Python, you already know CircuitPython. This may or may not be the final platform this would end up on, but it is SO FAST for getting up and running, and easily ported to Arduino when you're ready.


I doubt many people have my identical hardware, but I will happily test any PR's and share the results with you. I think I may get a few "standardized" voice samples to be used for testing so we can compare versions, so I would appreciate getting some of those in PR's as well.
